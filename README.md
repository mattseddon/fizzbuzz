# fizzbuzz ðŸ¦€

## To my future self

Remember that time when someone mentioned FizzBuzz on Discord and you had heard of it but realised that you didn't even know what the problem was???

Well... the code in this repository was written that night, for some reason in Rust, in the Rustiest way you knew at the time.

Note: See https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/issues/1245 for why I didn't have to validate the number passed to the CLI as positive.
